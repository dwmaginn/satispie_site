# Phase 1 Completion Summary — Planning & Requirements

## Objective
Establish project foundation (scope, content needs, technical approach) per Implementation plan Phase 1.

## Deliverables and Evidence

- Content audit and assets:
  - Asset inventory documented in `docs/asset-inventory.md`
  - Site map and migration mapping in `docs/site-map.md`

- Scope definition (features baseline):
  - Pages: Home, Products, Tips & Tricks, About, Contact, Apply Today, Where to Buy, 404, Privacy, Terms, Resources
  - Features: Header/navigation redesign, Footer with newsletter, Tips listing + detail, Contact form (Formspree), Careers form (Formspree), Store locator MVP (static/sample data + directions links), Structured data (Organization, FAQ, Product, Breadcrumb), Sitemap, Robots.txt, Analytics (GA4)

- Technical approach (summary):
  - Framework: Astro 5 + Tailwind CSS
  - Content: Astro content collections + Markdown for tips
  - Forms: Formspree endpoints (placeholders configured)
  - Store locator: MVP with sample data and Google Maps directions links; future upgrade to API/Maps integration
  - SEO: `@astrojs/sitemap`, JSON-LD via `src/components/common/StructuredData.astro`
  - Performance: `astro-compress`, Astro image service (AVIF/WEBP), critical CSS component in place
  - Analytics: GA4 via `src/components/common/Analytics.astro` reading ID from `src/config.yaml`

## Exit Criteria (Met)

- Content inventory completed → See `docs/asset-inventory.md`
- Feature list baseline signed off → Captured above and reflected in navigation/pages
- Technical strategy documented → Captured above and implemented in config/components

## Notes / Dependencies

- GA4 ID is placeholder in `src/config.yaml` and should be replaced with a real property ID before launch.
- Store locator uses sample data; production data source to be defined if/when upgraded.
