I’ll let you know as soon as the full execution package is ready.


# SatisPie Website Redesign – Execution Roadmap

## 1. Master Roadmap

**Hierarchical Phase & Batch Outline:** The project is organized into 8 sequential phases, each with clear objectives and subdivided into numbered batches (sprints) for incremental delivery. Each batch lists its start and end as offsets from project kickoff (T), exit criteria, and any prerequisites or dependencies.

1. **Phase 1: Planning & Requirements Gathering** – *Objective:* Establish project foundation (scope, content needs, technical approach).

   * **Batch 1.1 – Content Audit & Ideation** (Start: T + 0 days, End: T + 5 days): Review all existing site content, decide what to update or create anew; gather design inspirations and define style elements (palette, fonts, high-res logo).
     *Exit Criteria:* Content inventory completed; list of new content to write; moodboard/design reference compiled.
     *Dependencies:* Project kickoff complete; access to current site/content. *Prerequisites:* Stakeholder goals & brand assets provided.
   * **Batch 1.2 – Scope Definition & Tech Planning** (Start: T + 5 days, End: T + 7 days): Finalize in-scope features (e.g. confirm **Where to Buy** locator, newsletter, Careers page); determine technical approach for any complex features (store locator method, form handling), noting any API keys or environment needs.
     *Exit Criteria:* Features list baseline (what’s in/out) signed off; technical strategy documented (e.g. Google Maps usage decided, env variables noted).
     *Dependencies:* Batch 1.1 completion (content & ideas inform scope). *Prerequisites:* None (use initial requirements).

2. **Phase 2: Wireframing & Architecture** – *Objective:* Define site structure and low-fidelity UX for all pages.

   * **Batch 2.1 – Site Map & Wireframes** (Start: T + 8 days, End: T + 12 days): Confirm final site map/navigation, including new pages like “Where to Buy” and “About Us”. Create low-fi wireframes for key pages (Home, Products, Tips listing, About, Contact) focusing on layout and content placement.
     *Exit Criteria:* Approved site map diagram; wireframes sketched for all main page layouts.
     *Dependencies:* Phase 1 completion (scope & content needs). *Prerequisites:* Proposed site structure from implementation plan.
   * **Batch 2.2 – Review & Component Plan** (Start: T + 12 days, End: T + 14 days): Team/stakeholder review of wireframes and site structure; incorporate feedback to ensure consensus (avoids later rework). Plan Astro component architecture (header, footer, product card, etc.) needed for templates.
     *Exit Criteria:* Wireframes and navigation accepted by stakeholders; list of required Astro components documented.
     *Dependencies:* Batch 2.1 wireframes complete. *Prerequisites:* Alignment on branding and functionality from Phase 1.

3. **Phase 3: Visual Design Mockups** – *Objective:* Create high-fidelity UI designs for the site’s look and feel.

   * **Batch 3.1 – High-Fidelity Page Designs** (Start: T + 15 days, End: T + 22 days): Develop polished mockups for main pages (homepage first, then others) using chosen colors, imagery placeholders, and typography. Design all UI elements (buttons, forms, etc.) to meet modern, professional quality.
     *Exit Criteria:* Pixel-perfect mockups of all key pages (desktop) completed in Figma (or similar), ready for review.
     *Dependencies:* Phase 2 approval (site structure). *Prerequisites:* Brand style guide (colors, fonts), hi-res logo, reference websites for quality benchmark.
   * **Batch 3.2 – Responsive & Assets Prep** (Start: T + 22 days, End: T + 27 days): Design how layouts adapt to mobile (e.g. mobile menu, homepage). Conduct a design review with stakeholders to ensure the visuals meet the quality bar (compare against Sara Lee/Edwards sites) and adjust as needed. From finalized designs, compile a list of all required image assets with dimensions and notes (hero images, product photos, etc.).
     *Exit Criteria:* Mobile-responsive variations confirmed; all design mockups approved; asset checklist (with specs) completed.
     *Dependencies:* Batch 3.1 designs done. *Prerequisites:* Access to stock or product photos for mockups; stakeholder availability for design review.

4. **Phase 4: Content Creation** – *Objective:* Write and prepare all website copy and content in parallel with design.

   * **Batch 4.1 – Copywriting & SEO** (Start: T + 15 days, End: T + 23 days): Draft all page content (taglines, product descriptions, tips articles, about us story, form intro text) following the agreed tone/voice. Review and proofread content with stakeholders for accuracy (no typos, factual correctness). Incorporate SEO keywords strategically into copy (e.g. “pre-baked pies wholesale”) without sacrificing readability.
     *Exit Criteria:* All website copy written, reviewed, and approved; content is optimized for SEO and messaging.
     *Dependencies:* Phase 1 content audit (knowing what to write/update). *Prerequisites:* Final site map/wireframes (to know content needed per page).
   * **Batch 4.2 – Content Finalization & Entry Prep** (Start: T + 23 days, End: T + 27 days): Finalize any remaining content edits and obtain sign-off from Product Owner. Prepare content for integration – e.g. format tip articles in Markdown, organize product info in JSON – so that development can easily incorporate it.
     *Exit Criteria:* All content files (Markdown/JSON) ready for developers; content approval sign-off obtained.
     *Dependencies:* Batch 4.1 initial content drafted. *Prerequisites:* Phase 3 design (for context of content length/fit), style guide for tone consistency.

5. **Phase 5: Development (Astro Implementation)** – *Objective:* Build the site front-end per designs using Astro 5 and Tailwind CSS; integrate all content and features.

   * **Batch 5.1 – Project Setup & Global Components** (Start: T + 28 days, End: T + 32 days): Set up Astro project environment (ensure Astro v5, Tailwind, etc., are installed and up-to-date); create a new Git branch for the redesign. Implement global layout components: build `src/components/Header.astro` with new menu (including links to Where to Buy, About), adding a responsive mobile nav (hamburger toggle via Alpine.js or CSS). Build `src/components/Footer.astro` with redesigned footer (newsletter signup form, social icons). Update Tailwind config (brand colors, fonts) and global styles to match the design system. *(Dark mode and RTL support are out of scope, disabled if present).*
     *Exit Criteria:* Astro development environment running; header and footer components in place and responsive; global theme styles configured.
     *Dependencies:* Phase 3 design assets (logo, brand colors). *Prerequisites:* Repo access and dev environment tools.
   * **Batch 5.2 – Page Templates Implementation** (Start: T + 32 days, End: T + 40 days): Develop each page per the approved mockups, integrating real content:

     * **Homepage (`index.astro`)** – Build sections (hero, product highlights, tips teaser, etc.) with semantic HTML and Tailwind classes. Use placeholder or sample images (to be replaced with finals). Implement hero carousel (2–3 slides max) with a lightweight script, and embed or stub an Instagram feed section. Ensure prominent “Where to Buy” call-to-action.
     * **Products Page** – Create `src/pages/products.astro` (or `branded-products.astro`) and loop through product data to display all offerings in a responsive grid. Use thumbnails and names, leaving space for descriptions. Include category sections (Pies, Waffles, etc.) or filters if needed; consider pagination if the list grows long.
     * **Tips & Tricks Listing** – Build `src/pages/tips-and-tricks.astro` to list all tip articles. Each entry shows title, thumbnail, and excerpt, linking to its detail page. Implement as a blog index (Astro Content Collections or Markdown for tips).
     * **Tip Detail Pages** – For each tip (e.g. “how-to-slice-a-pie”), create a Markdown or `src/pages/tips/[slug].astro` page containing the article content. Ensure the template includes the article title, content (with subheadings, images), and author/date if applicable. Add a footer or sidebar suggesting related tips or a share button.
     * **Where To Buy** – Build `src/pages/where-to-buy.astro` with a ZIP code search form and results area. Initially, use either an embedded store locator widget (iframe) or a static list of stores by region as a fallback. Document the plan for a Google Maps API integration if needed later.
     * **About Us** – Implement `src/pages/about.astro` with headings and narrative text telling the SatisPie story. Insert images at appropriate spots (e.g. a hero banner or timeline photos) to enrich the story. If multiple milestones are mentioned, consider a simple timeline layout (CSS-based) for visual appeal. Highlight quality certifications (SQF, HACCP) with icons or badges.
     * **Contact Us** – Build `src/pages/contact-us.astro` containing a contact form (Name, Email, Phone, Message) styled with Tailwind forms. Connect the form action to the Formspree endpoint (temporary/test project key initially). Test form submission in dev to ensure emails send (use a test Formspree project). Also display contact info (address, email, phone) alongside or above the form, possibly with a small map icon next to address.
     * **Careers (Apply Today)** – Implement `src/pages/apply-today.astro` for job applications (if in scope). This form is longer; organize fields into two columns on desktop to avoid an excessively long page. The form submission also goes to Formspree (use a separate endpoint to distinguish job applications). Ensure mobile layout is user-friendly (stacked fields). After submission, show a confirmation message or redirect to a simple `thank-you.astro` page.
       *Exit Criteria:* All page templates are completed and styled per design; forms and interactive elements work in dev; placeholder images marked for replacement.
       *Dependencies:* Batches 5.1 (global components) and Phases 3–4 (approved design & content). *Prerequisites:* Finalized content files from Phase 4; design assets (images, icons) or placeholders.
   * **Batch 5.3 – Integration & Pre-QA Check** (Start: T + 40 days, End: T + 44 days): Add remaining global elements and clean up codebase. Implement a custom 404 page (`src/pages/404.astro`) with friendly message and link home. Remove any boilerplate files not used. Ensure SEO metadata (titles, meta descriptions) is set for each page (via Astro frontmatter or config). Generate a sitemap and verify all pages are included. During development, run accessibility checks (Lighthouse audit for color contrast, missing alts, etc.) and fix issues as you go. Perform a self-QA: click through the site in local build to catch obvious issues before formal testing.
     *Exit Criteria:* Codebase is production-ready (clean, with meta tags, sitemap); no known accessibility issues (Lighthouse score acceptable); developer self-QA passed.
     *Dependencies:* Batches 5.1 and 5.2 complete. *Prerequisites:* Phase 3 asset list (to ensure all images accounted for), content from Phase 4.

6. **Phase 6: Testing & QA** – *Objective:* Verify the site’s quality (functionality, compatibility, performance) and fix defects.

   * **Batch 6.1 – Full QA Testing** (Start: T + 45 days, End: T + 49 days): QA team conducts comprehensive testing across browsers and devices – verify layout on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge and mobile views. Test all functionality: submit forms (with test emails) to ensure success messages and Formspree integration work; exercise the carousel (auto-rotate, navigation arrows); test store locator with sample ZIP (or verify static store list accuracy). Check responsiveness by resizing screens – no elements should overlap or truncate. Click every internal/external link to catch any 404s or broken links. Run performance tests (Lighthouse/PageSpeed) – flag any heavy images or unminified JS for optimization. Validate SEO elements: unique `<title>` and meta description on each page, OpenGraph tags, and ensure the Google Analytics tracking code is present and firing (use Google Tag Manager or GA script with the provided ID). Finally, proofread the site content in situ to catch any typos or formatting issues that slipped through.
     *Exit Criteria:* All critical and high-priority bugs are identified and logged; preliminary performance and SEO checks are passed (or issues logged for fix); no lingering content errors.
     *Dependencies:* Phase 5 deployment to a testing/staging environment. *Prerequisites:* Completed site build (Phase 5); test environment or staging URL (if needed for external testers).
   * **Batch 6.2 – Bug Fixing & Verification** (Start: T + 49 days, End: T + 52 days): Development team fixes the issues found in Batch 6.1. This includes any visual or functional bug fixes, performance optimizations (compress images, tweak code), and final SEO tuning (e.g., add missing meta tags). QA re-tests the resolved issues and performs a regression test on critical paths.
     *Exit Criteria:* All test cases pass; zero open high-severity defects; site meets quality standards (performance, accessibility, SEO targets).
     *Dependencies:* Batch 6.1 test results. *Prerequisites:* Issue tracking system updated with test findings.

7. **Phase 7: Final Approval & Phase Gate** – *Objective:* Obtain stakeholder sign-off and make final tweaks before launch.

   * **Batch 7.1 – UAT & Stakeholder Review** (Start: T + 53 days, End: T + 55 days): Deploy the nearly-final site to a staging environment (or use Astro preview build) for stakeholders to experience it as end-users. The Sponsor and Product Owner perform User Acceptance Testing (UAT), verifying the site meets requirements and is visually on-brand. Collect any change requests or identify any last-minute issues.
     *Exit Criteria:* Stakeholders approve the site for launch (sign-off document received); UAT feedback addressed or scheduled (no blocking issues remain).
     *Dependencies:* Phase 6 (QA) complete with no showstopper bugs. *Prerequisites:* Staging URL or build accessible to stakeholders; test accounts for forms (so stakeholders can test safely).
   * **Batch 7.2 – Final Tweaks & Content Freeze** (Start: T + 55 days, End: T + 57 days): Implement any final changes from stakeholder review (e.g., minor content edits, spacing adjustments, last-minute fixes). Double-check that the site still meets the “polished design” benchmark – compare side-by-side with reference sites one last time. Once all tweaks are done, freeze content and code: merge the final approved changes into the main branch, preparing for launch.
     *Exit Criteria:* Codebase marked “release-ready”; final sign-off from Sponsor on go-live readiness.
     *Dependencies:* Batch 7.1 stakeholder feedback. *Prerequisites:* Sponsor approval to proceed to launch.

8. **Phase 8: Deployment & Launch** – *Objective:* Deploy the new site to production (IONOS) and conduct post-launch verifications.

   * **Batch 8.1 – Production Deployment** (Start: T + 58 days, End: T + 59 days): Merge the redesign branch into `main` and push to trigger IONOS static deployment. Verify build commands and environment variables are correctly set on IONOS (Astro prod build config matches expectations). Coordinate a switchover from the old site: take a backup of the current site (if not already) before deployment. Once deployed, perform a smoke test on the live production site (spot-check key pages, forms, and features in the live environment) to ensure nothing broke due to environment differences.
     *Exit Criteria:* New site is live on production URL; smoke tests pass (pages load, forms send, no glaring issues in prod). Old site safely archived or retrievable if rollback needed.
     *Dependencies:* Phase 7 complete (all approvals). *Prerequisites:* Credentials/access for production deployment; IONOS deployment pipeline configured.
   * **Batch 8.2 – Post-Launch Monitoring & Handoff** (Start: T + 60 days, End: T + 62 days): After launch, verify search engines are indexing the new site: submit the updated sitemap to Google Search Console and Bing (especially if URLs changed). Announce the new website on official channels – e.g. social media, press release, and kick off the newsletter sign-up outreach (if applicable). Closely monitor the site for a few days: check Google Analytics for traffic drop-offs or unusual user behavior, watch for any 404 errors or broken links in analytics reports. Confirm Formspree submissions are arriving properly (no form emails lost). Address any minor post-launch issues quickly (e.g., fix typos or broken links reported by users). Finally, hand over documentation to the client: provide style guides, how-to for adding new content, and a post-launch content schedule (to keep site content fresh as planned).
     *Exit Criteria:* Successful transition to steady-state: site is stable with no critical issues post-launch; search indexing in progress; stakeholders are informed how to maintain content going forward.
     *Dependencies:* Batch 8.1 (site live). *Prerequisites:* Google Analytics ID and access to Search Console; communication plan for launch announcements.

| 5.2.1       | 5.2           | Develop **Homepage** (`src/pages/index.astro`): Build out sections per design – hero carousel, product highlights, tips teaser, etc. Use semantic HTML5 (e.g., `<header>`, `<section>` tags). Apply Tailwind utility classes for spacing, colors, fonts to match the Figma design. Insert placeholder images where needed and actual copy from content file. Ensure “Where to Buy” button or link is prominent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Full-Stack Dev                                 | 12 h            | Homepage design (Task 3.1.2); homepage content (Task 4.1.1)                                                                                | `index.astro` page implemented; placeholder images noted (e.g., alt text says “Hero image placeholder”)                                                                          | Astro, Tailwind                               |
| 5.2.2       | 5.2           | Implement homepage **carousel** if in design: Use a lightweight JS library or custom code to rotate hero images. Limit to a few slides for performance. Ensure controls (prev/next arrows or dots) are styled in line with design and accessible (keyboard + aria labels). Test auto-rotation timing if applicable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Full-Stack Dev                                 | 6 h             | Carousel design details; library documentation (if using, e.g., Splide.js)                                                                 | Carousel component integrated on homepage, working in dev                                                                                                                        | JS library (if used)                          |
| 5.2.3       | 5.2           | Integrate **Instagram feed** on homepage (if required): If SatisPie has Instagram, embed a feed widget or use static images as placeholder with a “Follow us” link. Ensure it’s responsive. If no Instagram, omit or leave “Coming Soon” as plan suggests.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Full-Stack Dev                                 | 2 h             | Embed code from Instagram or alternative; design placeholder                                                                               | Instagram feed section in homepage (or placeholder message)                                                                                                                      | Astro, Instagram embed                        |
| 5.2.4       | 5.2           | Develop **Products** page (`src/pages/products.astro`): Import product data (from JSON created in Task 4.2.1). Loop through products to generate a card for each. Implement responsive grid: e.g., 2 columns on mobile, 4 on desktop. Include category headings (if needed for grouping pies vs waffles) and anchor links or filtering if product list is long. For each product card, display image (use a placeholder image filename from asset list) and product name; if descriptions are brief, include them.                                                                                                                                                                                | Full-Stack Dev                                 | 8 h             | Products page design (Task 3.1.3); product content file (Task 4.2.1)                                                                       | `products.astro` page functioning with dynamic content; stub images listed (to replace when available)                                                                           | Astro, Tailwind                               |
| 5.2.5       | 5.2           | Develop **Tips & Tricks listing** (`src/pages/tips-and-tricks.astro`): Use Astro Content Collections or `import.meta.glob` to gather all Markdown files for tips. For each tip, render a card with title, an image thumbnail, and excerpt (first \~20 words). Ensure layout matches design (probably a simple vertical list or grid). Each card links to its tip detail page (which will be markdown or an Astro page).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Full-Stack Dev                                 | 8 h             | Tips listing design (Task 3.1.4); tip articles (Task 4.2.1)                                                                                | `tips-and-tricks.astro` listing page with dynamic list of tips; Link structure set (e.g., `/tips/slug`)                                                                          | Astro content collections                     |
| 5.2.6       | 5.2           | Generate **Tip detail pages**: If using Markdown, ensure the content is picked up by Astro’s build. If using Astro pages for each tip, create a template component (e.g., `src/pages/tips/[slug].astro`) to render an individual tip. Include the article content, and perhaps author name/date if in frontmatter. At the bottom, add a simple “Back to Tips” link or list a related tip.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Full-Stack Dev                                 | 4 h             | Tip Markdown files (Task 4.2.1); tip page design (Task 3.1.4)                                                                              | Individual tip pages accessible (e.g., `.../tips/how-to-slice-a-pie` shows full article)                                                                                         | Astro, Markdown                               |
| 5.2.7       | 5.2           | Develop **Where To Buy** page (`src/pages/where-to-buy.astro`): Create a form with ZIP code input and Search button. If opting for an embedded solution, insert the iframe code provided by store locator service. If custom solution: prepare a placeholder map div and client-side JS that would (in future) call Google Maps API – for now, possibly implement a simplified static list of stores by region as the plan suggests. Clearly label regions or provide instructions (e.g., “Enter ZIP to find stores”).                                                                                                                                                                            | Full-Stack Dev                                 | 8 h             | Store locator design (if any); decision from Task 1.2.2 on approach; Implementation Plan fallback idea                                     | `where-to-buy.astro` page implemented; if static list used, content is in place; if dynamic, form ready and placeholder results logic done                                       | Astro, maybe Google Maps JS                   |
| 5.2.8       | 5.2           | Develop **About Us** page (`src/pages/about.astro`): Lay out content sections according to the design: e.g., introduction paragraph, timeline or story sections with headings. Insert provided content (Task 4.1.4) in appropriate places. For any milestones or dates, if timeline style is used, add HTML/CSS for it (could be a vertical timeline with year labels). Add images from asset list at meaningful breakpoints (hero image at top, perhaps inline images for historical photos). Ensure alt text is applied for each image.                                                                                                                                                         | Full-Stack Dev                                 | 6 h             | About content (Task 4.1.4); About page design (Task 3.1.5)                                                                                 | `about.astro` page with formatted story, images, and styling (including badges for certifications if provided)                                                                   | Astro, Tailwind                               |
| 5.2.9       | 5.2           | Develop **Contact Us** page (`src/pages/contact-us.astro`): Build the contact form with Name, Email, Phone, Message fields. Use Tailwind form classes to style inputs and textarea (rounded borders, matching focus states). Set the form `action` to the Formspree endpoint (from Task 5.1.7 environment vars or config). Implement basic client-side validation if easy (or rely on Formspree). Test form submission in dev mode (possibly to a test Formspree project). Also add the contact info section: e.g., company address, phone, email – use a simple `<address>` or list, styled per design. Include a map icon if provided.                                                          | Full-Stack Dev                                 | 6 h             | Contact page design (Task 3.1.6); Formspree endpoint (Task 5.1.7); contact content (Task 4.1.5)                                            | `contact-us.astro` page with working form (submits to Formspree) and contact details visible; confirmation UX (thank-you message or redirect, maybe handled by Formspree config) | Astro, Tailwind, Formspree                    |
| 5.2.10      | 5.2           | Develop **Careers/Apply** page (`src/pages/apply-today.astro`): Build the lengthy application form splitting into two columns or sections for desktop. Fields might include Name, Contact info, Position interested (if any), Resume upload (if out-of-scope for static, perhaps just a link to email?), etc., as per site map. Use multiple `<fieldset>` or `<section>` to visually group fields. Connect form action to a separate Formspree endpoint designated for job applications. Implement mobile layout with one column (all fields stacked). After submit, show a confirmation message or redirect to thank-you page (create `src/pages/thank-you.astro` if needed to handle redirect). | Full-Stack Dev                                 | 8 h             | Careers page design (Task 3.1.7); list of form fields from HR or Sponsor; Formspree endpoint for jobs; thank-you page content (Task 4.1.5) | `apply-today.astro` page with form (tested in dev); `thank-you.astro` page (generic confirmation) if used; job form submissions going to correct inbox                           | Astro, Tailwind, Formspree                    |

Ensure content/marketing team reviews messaging.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Product Owner / Sponsor                        | 2 h             | Company social media channels; draft announcement text                                                                                     | Social media posts (Facebook, LinkedIn, etc.) about new site; email blast to newsletter (if decided)                                                                             | Social media tools, Email platform            |
| 8.2.3       | 8.2           | Monitor Google Analytics for first-week traffic: verify that analytics data is coming in (traffic shows up for current date on GA dashboard). Watch bounce rates and time on page – any unusual patterns (like all users dropping off on a page might indicate an issue). Also check Real-Time analytics when testing forms or specific flows to confirm events.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | PM / QA                                        | 2 h             | GA dashboard (with site tracking ID access)                                                                                                | Confirmation GA is recording visits; note of any odd metrics to investigate (if any)                                                                                             | GA portal                                     |
| 8.2.4       | 8.2           | Monitor error logs and user feedback: Check the site’s error tracking (if any) or analytics for 404 pages over next few days. Ensure the Formspree submissions are arriving (maybe do one production test submission each day for first few days). If users report any issues (via support or social media), log and address them quickly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | PM / QA                                        | 2 h             | Formspree dashboard; analytics (behavior flow, 404s)                                                                                       | Post-launch issues log (should be empty or minor issues fixed immediately)                                                                                                       | Formspree logs, GA                            |

## 4. Phase Gate Checklists

At the end of each phase, a formal **Phase Gate** review ensures all objectives are met before moving forward. Below is the checklist of required evidence, sign-off authority, and contingency plan for each phase gate:

* **Phase 1 – Planning & Requirements Gate:**

  * *Objective Evidence:* Documented feature list (in-scope vs out-of-scope), content audit findings, and technical approach summary. Team alignment on project objectives and constraints.
  * *Sign-off Owner:* Product Owner (ensures the scope meets business goals) and Sponsor (acknowledges scope and resources).
  * *Fallback Plan:* If not approved, extend Planning phase – schedule a scope re-alignment meeting with Sponsor to clarify objectives or adjust scope. Iterate on requirements or descoping as needed, then re-seek sign-off.

* **Phase 2 – Wireframing & Architecture Gate:**

  * *Objective Evidence:* Approved site map (all pages identified) and wireframes for each key page. Stakeholder sign-off that structure and layout meet expectations (no major UX issues outstanding). Astro component list ready.
  * *Sign-off Owner:* Product Owner (UX/UI acceptance) and UX Lead (ensures design feasibility).
  * *Fallback Plan:* Conduct an additional review cycle – address stakeholder concerns (e.g., add missing page or revise layout) and repeat sign-off. If disagreements on structure, facilitate a workshop with stakeholders to reconcile before proceeding.

* **Phase 3 – Visual Design Mockups Gate:**

  * *Objective Evidence:* High-fidelity mockups for desktop and mobile for all core pages. All required visual assets identified (image to-do list). Stakeholder approval that design meets quality bar (visual style, branding).
  * *Sign-off Owner:* Product Owner (approves design) and Sponsor (signs off if they have brand oversight).
  * *Fallback Plan:* If designs are not approved, schedule a design review meeting to gather specific feedback. UI Designer revises mockups per feedback and resubmits for approval. If timing is tight, minor aesthetic differences may be noted for post-launch improvement to avoid delay, focusing on critical fixes only.

* **Phase 4 – Content Creation Gate:**

  * *Objective Evidence:* Complete set of website copy (all pages, tips articles) vetted for quality and SEO. Content is approved by stakeholders (no factual errors, tone is correct). Content files are prepared for integration (e.g., Markdown files ready).
  * *Sign-off Owner:* Product Owner (content accuracy and tone) and Sponsor or Marketing lead (if applicable, for brand voice).
  * *Fallback Plan:* If content is incomplete or unapproved, allocate additional writing/review time – potentially overlap with early dev work on structure (using placeholders) to maintain schedule. If approval is pending on certain sections, use placeholder text and flag those pages for later content insert (not ideal, but ensures dev can continue).

* **Phase 5 – Development (Astro) Gate:**

  * *Objective Evidence:* Fully functional staging site covering all scoped pages and features. All components implemented per design; internal code review done. Self-QA indicates no major functionality gap. Key technical metrics: passes accessibility baseline, performance reasonably optimized (e.g., Lighthouse scores good).
  * *Sign-off Owner:* Project Manager (ensures dev completeness) and Product Owner (validates that implementation matches requirements).
  * *Fallback Plan:* If site is not feature-complete or has quality issues, possibly extend development by a sprint. Reallocate resources (e.g., bring in additional dev help for backlog items). If only minor features are lagging, consider temporarily descoping non-critical features to keep timeline (e.g., disable an incomplete interactive element and launch without it, add later via update).

* **Phase 6 – Testing & QA Gate:**

  * *Objective Evidence:* QA test report with **zero critical bugs open** – all high-severity issues resolved or accepted. Cross-browser, mobile, and regression tests passed. Performance and SEO checks show no blocking issues (e.g., no pages missing meta or extremely slow loads). UAT environment ready for stakeholders.
  * *Sign-off Owner:* QA Engineer (quality certification) and Project Manager (all issues addressed, go/no-go decision for UAT).
  * *Fallback Plan:* If critical bugs persist, do not proceed to UAT. Extend QA phase – assign devs to fix remaining issues and have QA re-test. If timeline pressure, negotiate with Sponsor on possibly adjusting launch date or temporarily accepting a minor issue (with plan to hot-fix post-launch), but no critical/blocking issues should be carried forward.

* **Phase 7 – Final Approval (UAT) Gate:**

  * *Objective Evidence:* **User Acceptance Test sign-off** from Sponsor/Product Owner indicating the site is acceptable for launch. Any UAT change requests have been resolved in final build. Final pre-launch checklist (content freeze, legal approvals if any, all sign-offs documented) completed.
  * *Sign-off Owner:* Sponsor (final go-live authorization). Product Owner co-signs if Sponsor delegates detailed acceptance to them.
  * *Fallback Plan:* If Sponsor withholds approval due to serious concerns, address them immediately: e.g., fix any remaining issue or clarify misunderstanding. Potentially perform a quick round of fixes (Phase 7 extended) and re-run a brief UAT. In worst case, delay launch until the product meets the Sponsor’s expectations – use contingency launch date if one was identified.

* **Phase 8 – Launch Gate (Go/No-Go):**

  * *Objective Evidence:* All prior phase gates signed off. Deployment plan in place (including backup of old site, DNS ready). “Go Live” checklist ticked off: e.g., build is green, team on standby for launch window. Post-launch monitoring plan set.
  * *Sign-off Owner:* Sponsor (approves proceeding with launch at scheduled time, understanding associated risks) and Project Manager (ensures operational readiness).
  * *Fallback Plan:* If a no-go is decided (for instance, a last-minute high-risk issue emerges or external factor prevents launch date), postpone launch. Roll back any partial changes if needed (keep old site live). Announce internal delay if necessary. PM invokes contingency launch plan for a later date once the issue is resolved. Ensure communications (social/newsletter) are adjusted accordingly. Minimal disruption to users by keeping existing site until new launch.

## 5. Integrated Timeline

The following timeline outlines all phases, indicating overlaps and the **critical path**. Timeframes are given in relative terms from project start (T = Kickoff). Phases 3 (Design) and 4 (Content) run in parallel to compress schedule, and Phase 5 (Development) begins as soon as essential design components are ready (not waiting for all content to be finalized). This overlapping is intentional to meet the overall deadline. The **critical path** (marked in **bold** on the timeline) flows through tasks that cannot slip without affecting the final launch date (Planning → Wireframing → Visual Design → Development → QA → Final Approval → Launch). Non-critical phases (Content writing) overlap and buffer the critical path.

**Timeline Key Milestones:**

* *T = Project Kickoff (Day 0).*
* Phase 1 (Planning) runs T+0 to T+5 (**critical path**).
* Phase 2 (Wireframing) runs T+6 to T+10 (**critical**).
* Phase 3 (Design) runs T+11 to T+20 (**critical**).
* Phase 4 (Content) runs T+11 to T+22 (parallel to Phase 3; not on critical path if completed by T+22).
* Phase 5 (Development) runs T+21 to T+35 (**critical**; starts overlap as design finishes main pages).
* Phase 6 (QA) runs T+36 to T+40 (**critical**).
* Phase 7 (Final UAT) runs T+41 to T+43 (**critical**; short phase for sign-off).
* Phase 8 (Launch) runs T+44 to T+45 (**critical** for go-live, with monitoring continuing through T+47).

```

*Notes:* In the chart above, Phase 4 (Content) begins around day 11-12, overlapping with the latter half of Phase 3 (Design), as content writing starts once page structure is known and runs parallel. The critical path assumes design completion is the gate for development; content finalization slightly overlaps but is completed before end of development (so as not to delay QA). The **critical path** is highlighted – delays in those phases directly impact the final launch. This sequencing ensures the website is production-ready for full deploy by Phase 8 as required. After launch (Phase 8), monitoring continues (not shown in detail on chart) but does not affect the launch date critical path.

## 6. Risk & Mitigation Register

The table below lists **key project risks** (at least 10) spanning technical challenges, timeline issues, resource constraints, asset delivery, compliance, and SEO concerns. Each risk is assessed for likelihood and impact (High/Medium/Low), along with mitigation strategies to reduce probability, contingency plans to minimize impact if the risk occurs, and an **Owner** responsible for managing that risk.

| **R1. Astro v5 Learning Curve** – The dev team is new to Astro 5.0, which could slow development or cause mistakes. *Tech risk.*                                                                               |     Medium     |   Medium   | Use official Astro starter template and follow docs. Allocate time for a short Astro training or spike early on. Pair programming on complex Astro components. Leverage Astro community resources if stuck.                                                                                                           | If delays occur, get quick support (Astro forums/Discord). If a feature proves too complex in Astro, implement a simpler static workaround to stay on schedule.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Full-Stack Dev |
| **R2. Store Locator Complexity** – Implementing the “Where to Buy” map search could be more difficult than expected (API issues, complexity). *Technical & timeline risk.*                                     |     Medium     |    High    | Decide approach early (Phase 1): if Google Maps API integration is too heavy, use the simpler static store list method described in plan. Time-box the development of any custom map script.                                                                                                                          | If custom locator isn’t ready, launch with a static “Find Stores” list (by region/state) and note “improved search coming soon.” Add the interactive map post-launch rather than delaying entire site.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Full-Stack Dev |
| **R3. Content Delays** – Writing or approval of content takes longer than planned, potentially delaying integration. *Timeline risk.*                                                                          |     Medium     |    High    | Start content creation early (in parallel with design). Set interim deadlines for drafts and reviews. Involve stakeholders in iterative content reviews to catch issues early.                                                                                                                                        | If final content is not ready by dev Phase, use placeholder text for late sections (marked clearly) and proceed. Product Owner to prioritize late content; if absolutely needed, extend content phase without blocking dev (content freeze as late as Phase 7).                                                                                                                                                                                            | Content Writer |
| **R4. Stakeholder Slow Feedback** – Sponsor or key reviewers exceed the 24h review window assumption, causing bottlenecks at approvals (design, UAT). *Timeline risk.*                                         |       Low      |   Medium   | Schedule review meetings in advance for each phase gate to get immediate feedback (rather than wait for offline review). Provide clear, concise design/copy briefs to streamline feedback. Emphasize the timeline urgency to stakeholders.                                                                            | If feedback is delayed, PM to escalate to Sponsor (remind of timeline). Use interim approvals: e.g., Product Owner provisionally approves to keep work moving, then adjust later if Sponsor objects (for non-critical aesthetic issues). Build a buffer day into schedule for each approval cycle.                                                                                                                                                         | PM             |
| **R5. Image Assets Not Ready** – Required imagery (product photos, hero shots) are delayed or not high-quality, threatening design quality. *Asset risk.*                                                      |     Medium     |   Medium   | Clearly communicate needed images and deadlines to Sponsor early, using the image to-do list. Have placeholders and plan for AI-generated or stock images if real photos delay. Use Astro Image component to easily swap in higher-res images later without code changes.                                             | If key images are missing at launch, proceed with high-quality placeholders that fit style. Post-launch, update the site as soon as real images arrive (Astro’s build makes it easy to deploy asset updates). Possibly schedule a professional photoshoot early in project to avoid this.                                                                                                                                                                  | UI Designer    |
| **R6. Accessibility Compliance Gaps** – The site might launch with accessibility issues (e.g., low contrast, missing alt tags) leading to compliance problems or user exclusion. *Compliance risk.*            |       Low      |   Medium   | Integrate a11y checks into development (Lighthouse audits during dev). Designer to follow accessible design principles (font sizes, contrast). QA to run dedicated accessibility tests in Phase 6. Fix issues as critical bugs.                                                                                       | If an issue is discovered late (e.g., by an outside user post-launch), treat it as top-priority fix in post-launch maintenance. Have a hotfix process ready for quick deployment of accessibility fixes. Provide an accessibility statement on site acknowledging any issues and commitment to fix (if needed to mitigate legal risk until fixed).                                                                                                         | QA Engineer    |
| **R7. SEO Ranking Drop** – A significant drop in search engine rankings or traffic after launch (due to site structure changes, missing SEO elements). *SEO risk.*                                             |       Low      |    High    | Mitigation baked into plan: preserve content relevant to SEO, add meta titles/descriptions on all pages, submit sitemap on launch, and ensure old URLs either remain or are 301-redirected to new paths if changed. Use keywords in content as per plan.                                                              | If post-launch traffic drops, immediately evaluate causes: check Google Search Console for crawl errors, implement 301 redirects for any missing ones, add back any critical keywords or content that might have been removed. Possibly run a quick SEO audit with a tool and fix issues. Sponsor/Product Owner to prepare a communication to customers if needed (e.g., “New site launched – here’s how to find things”) to bridge any temporary SEO gap. | Product Owner  |
| **R8. Team Member Unavailability** – A key team member (e.g., the only Full-Stack Dev or Content Writer) becomes unavailable (illness or leave) during a critical period, impacting delivery. *Resource risk.* |       Low      |    High    | Cross-train team members where possible (e.g., have a backup dev familiar with project, even if part-time). Maintain good documentation (so someone stepping in can get up to speed). PM to monitor workload and have an external contractor option identified if needed.                                             | If it occurs, redistribute tasks among remaining team: e.g., UX Lead or DevOps with coding experience helps with dev tasks; PM or Product Owner may assist with content polish. Potentially engage an external freelancer on short notice (having provided them access to repo/designs earlier as contingency). Adjust timeline if loss is critical, and inform Sponsor early to reset expectations.                                                       | PM             |
| **R9. Deployment Issues on IONOS** – The site might not build or deploy correctly on the IONOS environment (differences from local, build errors), causing launch delays. *Technical risk.*                    |       Low      |   Medium   | Set up a test deployment to IONOS (or similar environment) early – perhaps deploy a placeholder site or the partially built site mid-project to smoke out any pipeline issues. Ensure environment variables and build commands are documented and tested. Use Astro’s static nature to advantage (simpler deploy).    | If deployment fails at launch time, have a rollback: keep the old site up. DevOps and Dev quickly troubleshoot logs; as backup, prepare a static export of the site that could be served via an alternate host (in worst case). Communicate with IONOS support if needed. Could temporarily host on an alternate static hosting (Netlify, etc.) if IONOS issue is unresolved, then cut DNS to that host as a short-term workaround.                        | DevOps         |
| **R10. Scope Creep / New Requests** – Stakeholders request additional features (e.g., extra pages, new functionality) mid-project, threatening timeline and budget. *Scope/timeline risk.*                     |     Medium     |   Medium   | Lock down scope in Phase 1 with a signed-off feature list. Any change requests go through change control: PM communicates impact on timeline and seeks Sponsor approval. Defer non-critical extras to post-launch (“Phase 9”) as enhancements. Keep a “nice-to-have” list, but clearly separate from committed scope. | If a scope change is mandated (e.g., sudden business need), assess if it can be accommodated by swapping out something else or adding resources. Alternatively, consider a phased launch: launch core site on time, schedule the new feature in a subsequent update. Communicate to Sponsor any launch delay if they prioritize scope over schedule, and get written confirmation.                                                                         | PM             |
| **R11. Third-Party Service Failures** – Services like Formspree or Instagram embed might fail or impose unexpected limits (e.g., Formspree free tier email limit). *Technical risk.*                           |       Low      |     Low    | Use known reliable configurations (Formspree configuration tested in staging). Monitor during testing for any warning (Formspree sends alerts if over quota). For Instagram, use static fallback if embed doesn’t work reliably.                                                                                      | If Formspree stops working (e.g., hits limit), quickly upgrade to a paid tier or switch to an alternate form handler (there are other similar services) – since forms are simple, switching endpoint is quick. If any embed fails, temporarily remove it (better to have missing feed than broken page). Document how to swap keys or providers quickly.                                                                                                   | Full-Stack Dev |

## 7. Communications Plan

A clear communication plan ensures all team members and stakeholders stay informed and aligned throughout the project. This includes regular meetings, asynchronous updates, decision tracking, and escalation paths for issues:

* **Meetings & Ceremonies:**

  * *Kickoff Meeting (T = 0):* Project Manager hosts a project launch meeting with Sponsor, Product Owner, and team to confirm objectives, roles, and timeline.
  * *Daily Stand-ups:* 15-minute daily team check-in (Full-Stack Dev, Content Writer, UX/UI, PM, QA) during active development phases (Phases 3–6) to share progress, blockers, and plan for the day.
  * *Weekly Progress Reviews:* A weekly meeting (e.g., every Friday) with Product Owner (and Sponsor as needed) to demo completed batches or show interim results (wireframes, mockups, etc.) and ensure alignment. Especially at end of each phase, use this as a phase sign-off review.
  * *Design Review Meeting:* At the end of Phase 3, UX/UI lead presents the high-fidelity designs to Sponsor/Product Owner for feedback (as part of sign-off).
  * *Phase Gate Meetings:* At each phase completion, PM holds a short review meeting with accountable roles to verify exit criteria (using the checklists above) before formally moving to next phase.
  * *UAT Session:* During Phase 7, organize a guided UAT walkthrough with Sponsor and key stakeholders (could be a live meeting or screen-share) to get immediate feedback as they use the staging site.
  * *Project Retrospective:* After launch, team meets to discuss lessons learned, what went well, and improvement opportunities to document for future projects.

* **Asynchronous Updates:**

  * *Project Channel:* Maintain a dedicated Slack/Teams channel for the project. Team shares daily updates and quick questions here. PM posts end-of-day summaries during critical phases (“Today we completed X, Y; tomorrow planned Z; no blockers”).
  * *Weekly Status Email:* PM sends a concise weekly status report to Sponsor and stakeholders summarizing accomplishments (e.g., “Phase 2 completed, wireframes approved”), upcoming tasks, any risks or issues, and any assistance needed. This keeps those who can’t attend meetings informed.
  * *Task Tracking:* Use a shared task board (e.g., GitHub Projects or Jira) visible to all. Each WBS task is tracked with status. Team members update task status and comments asynchronously. Stakeholders with access can check progress at any time.
  * *Decision Log:* Maintain a running **Decision Log** in the project wiki or SharePoint. Every major decision (scope changes, technical approach choices, design deviations) is recorded with date, rationale, and who approved it. This ensures asynchronous visibility into why certain decisions were made (preventing revisiting old discussions).
  * *Documentation Repository:* Store all key documents (requirements, design files, content drafts, test plans) in a shared folder or project wiki, accessible by the team. Update these asynchronously so everyone always sees the latest versions.

* **Decision Logging:**

  * The PM is responsible for updating the **decision log** after meetings or discussions. For example, if in Phase 1 the team decides to include the Careers page now rather than later, PM logs: “**Decision 2025-01-05:** Careers page IN scope for launch, per Sponsor (impacts content and dev).”
  * The log is reviewed briefly in weekly meetings to ensure everyone is aware of recent decisions. Having this log prevents confusion and provides historical context for newcomers or for Phase 7/8 handoffs.

* **Escalation Path:**

  * *Team-Level Issue Resolution:* If any team member encounters a blocker (technical challenge, waiting on input) they raise it in daily stand-up or Slack immediately. The PM or relevant lead addresses it within the team (e.g., dev and UX collaborate to resolve a design-feasibility issue).
  * *Major Issues:* If an issue cannot be resolved at the team level within 1 business day, PM escalates to the Product Owner. For example, a requirement ambiguity or scope creep request – PM discusses with Product Owner for a decision.
  * *Scope/Timeline Changes:* If any change threatens timeline or budget, PM alerts the Sponsor via email or a call as soon as possible. An urgent meeting may be called if needed. Sponsor (or steering committee, if exists) has final say on scope trade-offs or timeline shifts.
  * *Sponsor Escalation:* The Sponsor should be informed immediately of any critical risk materializing (e.g., a launch date slip risk, or a show-stopper issue in UAT). The escalation path is PM → Sponsor for such high-level decisions. The Sponsor will then consult with PM and Product Owner on how to proceed (e.g., approve additional resources or adjust project goals).
  * *Emergency Communication:* Establish clear protocol for any launch-day issues – e.g., a Slack/Teams war-room chat during the launch window with Sponsor and DevOps included to communicate in real-time. If the site experiences a critical failure on launch, DevOps and Full-Stack Dev work to resolve within a short window; if not resolved, Sponsor/PM make the call to rollback to the old site (contingency) until fixed.
  * *Hierarchy:* In summary – **team member → PM → Product Owner → Sponsor** is the chain for escalating issues or decisions, depending on severity and impact.

* **Communication of Changes:** Any changes in schedule (like meeting times, or phase adjustments) are promptly communicated by the PM via email and Slack to all team members and stakeholders. The project timeline is kept updated in the shared schedule document.

By following this communication plan, the project ensures transparency, quick issue resolution, and stakeholder engagement throughout the SatisPie website redesign, ultimately supporting a smooth project execution and successful launch.
